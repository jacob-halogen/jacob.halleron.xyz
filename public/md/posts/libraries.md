# Libraries

The libraries section of my university's website describes nine facilities, of which only eight are actually libraries. The Museum of Archaeology - despite not being a library - found its way on to the list, so I'll include it in my review too. Omitted from this page are at least five libraries which are not open to all students, but instead exclusively serve certain halls of residence on campus. To be sure, these libraries are part of the university and should be included on the list, but their books are sealed off from the majority of students in what can only be viewed as a directed attack at eager library enthusiasts like me.

## Djanogly LRC

Djanogly's main gimmick is that it looks like an enormous floating Beyblade. It's comprised of a single room wound up in a conical spiral, so it has 1 or 4 stories depending on how you look at it, with an oppositely wound spiral staircase in the middle. Ostensibly, it's name is "The Sir Harry And Lady Djanogly Learning Resource Centre", which is a comically unweildy name used by nobody. What even is a learning resource centre if not just a library? The books in here are largely unperusable (it houses education and computer science) though the peculiar shape of the room would make perusing awkward as the bookshelves are not segregated from study spaces like most libraries. My preferred spot is on floor 3-ish, a well-graffitied desk nestled between volumes of Soviet education journals.

Djanogly's primary flaw is that the stairs are at an awkward height. Human feet expect steps to be at a very specific height but the staircase in the core of the library defies this in an effort to match the gradient of the outer spiral. It forces me to make strides so long that my gait is made goofy, stumbly, and not at all the well-tuned effortless-looking hot guy walk that I usually have. The toilets are splendid.

#### Medical

To nobody's surprise, the medical library smells like hand sanitiser.
